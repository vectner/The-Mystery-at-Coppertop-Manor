I strayed from my mentor, a priest in his middle years with a soft voice and ring of grey-dappled hair about a balding head, to approach a statue set aside within a shadowed alcove.  It depicted our god in his humanoid form, an elderly man standing strictly at attention, his wild hair hanging as long as his chest length beard, a staff topped with a stern faced sun clutched in his hand.  I knelt, still only fourteen, before this statue and began to pray right then.  The next six years of my acolyte training would be nothing but a blessing, I knew. <br /><em>“The Gleaming Star”, by Bishop Bernard Portis.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Acolytes are those devoted followers of a particular goddess or god who have decided to take on the mantle of the clergy to better serve their chosen deity.  Often no older than teenagers (though some acolytes begin later in their lives) acolytes are trained for a number of years (typically between three to ten) depending on the strictures of their deity's doctrines.  During their time they memorize and study all written materials concerning their deity and their teachings, learn magics (be they healing or harmful) gifted to the acolytes by their deities, and often go out into their community to provide aid to those in need or proselytize the words of their goddess or god.  Though not every acolyte climbs the ranks into full fledged priesthood, many remain highly dedicated to the church and remain to serve as life-long acolytes working closely with the lay community outside the temple walls.</p>\n<p>Recall that acolytes are trained in the arcane ways of their chosen deities.  This being the case, acolytes rarely receive sufficient martial training in comparison to the paladin ranks of the temple (unless expressly dictated otherwise by their deity's teachings).  This being the case, the acolyte is able to unleash some basic divine magic in order to both defend themselves and allies or to call upon their patron deity for aid for injured parties.  Typically expelled in a gleaming shower of golden sparks and dazzlingly vibrant lights, the magic of the gods is truly something special, even at such a base nature.  Spells such as Cure Wounds, Sacred Flame, or Sanctuary are all practiced by acolytes early on into their divine studies.  Acolytes can make handy allies should you be in need of divine protection or a field medic for an injured compatriot.  Be sure to mind your acolyte well, however, as their spellwork can easily be interrupted if they are forced into a melee fight with a band of slavering gnolls.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope

Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities. Be they a sly Dragonborn merchant, a boisterous Human tavern owner, or an elvish glassblower of supreme skills, the commoner befits those often outside the nobility. Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware.

Cultists, as their name describes, are those members of a secret underground society (or cult) whom very often practice a dark and unholy religion with their fellows. Beware adventurer! Not every cult is simply based around religious pretexts, there are those who seek political movements, those who are power hungry, and those who deign to meddle with forces our histories have lost long ago. Let me describe for you the very basics of common cult activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Friends on the Other Side.</strong> Cultists operate entirely in secrecy outside of the normal comings and goings of everyday life. What makes the cultist so fascinating is that they often attempt to blend seamlessly in with common folk: the barkeep at your favorite tavern, the guard near the gate, or even the dancer upon the stage may all be part of an underground community based ostensibly in evil. Now, to be clear, I do not encourage paranoia as cult activity is relatively rare in comparison to other, more immediate threats to our world; however, should a clever adventurer keep a keen eye out for secretive motions or gestures, odd symbols or markings, and even whispered code words, they can be certain they have stumbled into the workings of a cult. Quite commonly cultists align themselves with an ancient power trapped or dormant somewhere upon one of the more foul planes of existence. Their goals with this dark, godly force are myriad but often include control of a political structure, the deaths of hundreds if not thousands, or simply to sew despair and chaos across the realms of mortals. Unlike the desperate and cowardly bandits pushed to the brink by circumstance, cultists are often irredeemable foes. These men and women have been programed, brain-washed, or even directly controlled by their benefactor into the ways of darkness; often they are unfortunately unable to return to society once they have ingratiated themselves too deeply within the cult's network. Cults should always be handled and broken up with the utmost care; though the humanoid pawns behind the cult can be more easily dealt with, it should be remembered that cosmically evil forces may be at work and already set well into motion behind those pawns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any Non-Good Alignment","race":null,"type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":null,"cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language (usually Common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":1,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"name":"Cultist","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/Cultist.webp","actorId":"qkLNA1lKMMJpxuWg","alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}}},"items":[{"_id":"nfPMecUVS2iOgAKJ","name":"Leather Armor","type":"equipment","img":"icons/equipment/chest/breastplate-quilted-brown.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil.

Dwellers of the coastal urban sprawl see the armored law keepers near daily as they patrol the streets, guard our gates, inspect shipments, and of course assist (or arrest) those citizens of their fair cities. However, the guard is not only bound by the gates and ramparts of a city's walls. Be they mercenary or professional, guards are often found patrolling the roads, either to sweep away stray packs of animals or bandits, or on alert to protect precious cargo or important citizens as they travel the less settled areas of the world. Much like the bandits and cultists who we have previously discussed in this tome, guards come in all varieties. Though many may seem to be highly trained and regimented, it should be considered that most guards see no more action than a tussle on the busy streets of a market or scattering a few bandit scavengers from an upturned wagon. Guards are not all the hardened and grizzled ex-military types we think of at the upper ranks of the orders.

Note:  Please see below the entry for “Rat” which will suffice for the description of this creature.  Please note that “Swarms” function slightly differently in combat than singular creatures.  Please use the rules for “Swarms” befitting your particular game system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Denizens of filth, scavengers in our sewers, and vectors of contaigens, no singular animal may present such an impact upon humanoid life as does the rat.  Common place from the sprawling urban metropolis to the tiny barn of a poor farmer, rats inhabit every nook and cranny they may scurry in to.  These small rodents, who can range in size from no bigger than your palm to the length of a forearm (with tail included) are quite ingenious little thieves.  Rats are able to compress their bodies in such a manner that they can fit through spaces as small as the gap in the bottom of your door.  Able to swim and navigate in the dark, some rats have been observed climbing out of small plumbing pipes, having scampered through the length of the tunnel to make it inside a merchant's abode.</p>\n<p><strong>Rats Off to You.</strong> While many may dismiss the rat as nothing more than a common pest, even those not utilized as magical familiars are highly intelligent little creatures.  Researchers have observed rats completing complex mazes, solving lever-action puzzles, and understanding the world around them to a degree unseen in other animals.  A clever street-dweller could certainly train a rat to filch food or a few shiny coins from an unwatched coin purse, should the rat get adequate reward itself.  Do be wise in your selection of companion, however, as some rats carry deadly diseases from insects that nestle in their short fur.  Along with its sharp, clinging claws, the rat packs a powerful bite thanks to its elongated incisor teeth.  Be observant, young hero, should you see a rat nearby, for the simple creature may house a secret within its black, unblinking eyes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope

zombies will not be able to reclaim a weapon should they be disarmed as the lack of weapon will simply drive them to claw with their broken hands.  The magic which binds the zombie to the mortal plane is tricky to the uninitiated as well, so please be warned young adventurers!  Should you fell a zombie, be aware that the creature may not be fully dead for the second time;

I strayed from my mentor, a priest in his middle years with a soft voice and ring of grey-dappled hair about a balding head, to approach a statue set aside within a shadowed alcove.  It depicted our god in his humanoid form, an elderly man standing strictly at attention, his wild hair hanging as long as his chest length beard, a staff topped with a stern faced sun clutched in his hand.  I knelt, still only fourteen, before this statue and began to pray right then.  The next six years of my acolyte training would be nothing but a blessing, I knew. <br /><em>“The Gleaming Star”, by Bishop Bernard Portis.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Acolytes are those devoted followers of a particular goddess or god who have decided to take on the mantle of the clergy to better serve their chosen deity.  Often no older than teenagers (though some acolytes begin later in their lives) acolytes are trained for a number of years (typically between three to ten) depending on the strictures of their deity's doctrines.  During their time they memorize and study all written materials concerning their deity and their teachings, learn magics (be they healing or harmful) gifted to the acolytes by their deities, and often go out into their community to provide aid to those in need or proselytize the words of their goddess or god.  Though not every acolyte climbs the ranks into full fledged priesthood, many remain highly dedicated to the church and remain to serve as life-long acolytes working closely with the lay community outside the temple walls.</p>\n<p>Recall that acolytes are trained in the arcane ways of their chosen deities.  This being the case, acolytes rarely receive sufficient martial training in comparison to the paladin ranks of the temple (unless expressly dictated otherwise by their deity's teachings).  This being the case, the acolyte is able to unleash some basic divine magic in order to both defend themselves and allies or to call upon their patron deity for aid for injured parties.  Typically expelled in a gleaming shower of golden sparks and dazzlingly vibrant lights, the magic of the gods is truly something special, even at such a base nature.  Spells such as Cure Wounds, Sacred Flame, or Sanctuary are all practiced by acolytes early on into their divine studies.  Acolytes can make handy allies should you be in need of divine protection or a field medic for an injured compatriot.  Be sure to mind your acolyte well, however, as their spellwork can easily be interrupted if they are forced into a melee fight with a band of slavering gnolls.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope

Commoners come in all races, social classes, professions, and personalities. Be they a sly Dragonborn merchant, a boisterous Human tavern owner, or an elvish glassblower of supreme skills, the commoner befits those often outside the nobility. Commoners may be intelligent or foolish, mighty or cowardly; certainly a commoner should be admired for their uniqueness in our world. A commoner may be found wherever humanoids exist: cities, villages, out on the roads, forests, mountains, anywhere that has felt the touch of humanoids you may find a commoner there.</p>\n<p><strong>Power to the Proletariat.</strong> A certain fact about commoners is that they are often more average citizens of our world. They are not like the bold adventurer and prefer to live their lives under the presumption of peace outside of their city walls. This is not to say, however, that even a single commoner (though more often mob mentality rules) can rise up and begin a stunning brawl of their own. Beware, adventurers, for even a seemingly simple commoner can fight dirty and surprise a seasoned fighter. However, a majority of commoners are less skilled in the martial arts, so do not be surprised if they reach for uncommon weapons to defend themselves including: clubs, broken bottles, chairs, barrels, stones, and cookware. Be they within a city or out on the open trail, it is always wise to maintain peace with the common-folk, for they may hide a set of skills or clever information that lies deep below their simple venere.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any","race":null,"type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":null,"cr":"0","spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":10},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language (usually Common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"name":"Commoner","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":0,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/Commoner.webp","actorId":"SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq","alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}}},"items":[{"_id":"HwktDnB8qdr0BYGZ","name":"Club","type":"weapon","img":"icons/weapons/clubs/club-simple-barbed.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+2 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.

Cultists, as their name describes, are those members of a secret underground society (or cult) whom very often practice a dark and unholy religion with their fellows. Beware adventurer! Not every cult is simply based around religious pretexts, there are those who seek political movements, those who are power hungry, and those who deign to meddle with forces our histories have lost long ago. Let me describe for you the very basics of common cult activity.</p>\n<p><strong>Friends on the Other Side.</strong> Cultists operate entirely in secrecy outside of the normal comings and goings of everyday life. What makes the cultist so fascinating is that they often attempt to blend seamlessly in with common folk: the barkeep at your favorite tavern, the guard near the gate, or even the dancer upon the stage may all be part of an underground community based ostensibly in evil. Now, to be clear, I do not encourage paranoia as cult activity is relatively rare in comparison to other, more immediate threats to our world; however, should a clever adventurer keep a keen eye out for secretive motions or gestures, odd symbols or markings, and even whispered code words, they can be certain they have stumbled into the workings of a cult. Quite commonly cultists align themselves with an ancient power trapped or dormant somewhere upon one of the more foul planes of existence. Their goals with this dark, godly force are myriad but often include control of a political structure, the deaths of hundreds if not thousands, or simply to sew despair and chaos across the realms of mortals. Unlike the desperate and cowardly bandits pushed to the brink by circumstance, cultists are often irredeemable foes. These men and women have been programed, brain-washed, or even directly controlled by their benefactor into the ways of darkness; often they are unfortunately unable to return to society once they have ingratiated themselves too deeply within the cult's network. Cults should always be handled and broken up with the utmost care; though the humanoid pawns behind the cult can be more easily dealt with, it should be remembered that cosmically evil forces may be at work and already set well into motion behind those pawns.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any Non-Good Alignment","race":null,"type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":null,"cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 345","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language (usually Common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"dec":{"value":1,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":1,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"name":"Cultist","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/Cultist.webp","actorId":"qkLNA1lKMMJpxuWg","alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}}},"items":[{"_id":"nfPMecUVS2iOgAKJ","name":"Leather Armor","type":"equipment","img":"icons/equipment/chest/breastplate-quilted-brown.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil.

Dwellers of the coastal urban sprawl see the armored law keepers near daily as they patrol the streets, guard our gates, inspect shipments, and of course assist (or arrest) those citizens of their fair cities. However, the guard is not only bound by the gates and ramparts of a city's walls. Be they mercenary or professional, guards are often found patrolling the roads, either to sweep away stray packs of animals or bandits, or on alert to protect precious cargo or important citizens as they travel the less settled areas of the world. Much like the bandits and cultists who we have previously discussed in this tome, guards come in all varieties. Though many may seem to be highly trained and regimented, it should be considered that most guards see no more action than a tussle on the busy streets of a market or scattering a few bandit scavengers from an upturned wagon. Guards are not all the hardened and grizzled ex-military types we think of at the upper ranks of the orders. Be observant, young adventurer, and heed the warnings of the law, for while the guards may only be a minor threat to your dastardly visions, what lays in wait in the city dungeon may not be worth the risks!</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Any Alignment","race":null,"type":{"value":"humanoid","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":null,"cr":0.125,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":25},"source":"MM pg. 347","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":[],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"any one language (usually Common)"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"prc":{"value":1,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":12,"prof":2,"total":2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":0,"bonus":0,"passive":10,"prof":0,"total":0}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"name":"Guard","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/humanoid/Guard.webp","actorId":"E9CvDPDg5dFEpVjS","alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}}},"items":[{"_id":"2reHgwNJRFbhmxqA","name":"Chain Shirt","type":"equipment","img":"icons/equipment/chest/breastplate-metal-scaled-grey.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather.

Note:  Please see below the entry for “Rat” which will suffice for the description of this creature.  Please note that “Swarms” function slightly differently in combat than singular creatures.  Please use the rules for “Swarms” befitting your particular game system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Denizens of filth, scavengers in our sewers, and vectors of contaigens, no singular animal may present such an impact upon humanoid life as does the rat.  Common place from the sprawling urban metropolis to the tiny barn of a poor farmer, rats inhabit every nook and cranny they may scurry in to.  These small rodents, who can range in size from no bigger than your palm to the length of a forearm (with tail included) are quite ingenious little thieves.  Rats are able to compress their bodies in such a manner that they can fit through spaces as small as the gap in the bottom of your door.  Able to swim and navigate in the dark, some rats have been observed climbing out of small plumbing pipes, having scampered through the length of the tunnel to make it inside a merchant's abode.</p>\n<p><strong>Rats Off to You.</strong> While many may dismiss the rat as nothing more than a common pest, even those not utilized as magical familiars are highly intelligent little creatures.  Researchers have observed rats completing complex mazes, solving lever-action puzzles, and understanding the world around them to a degree unseen in other animals.  A clever street-dweller could certainly train a rat to filch food or a few shiny coins from an unwatched coin purse, should the rat get adequate reward itself.  Do be wise in your selection of companion, however, as some rats carry deadly diseases from insects that nestle in their short fur.  Along with its sharp, clinging claws, the rat packs a powerful bite thanks to its elongated incisor teeth.  Be observant, young hero, should you see a rat nearby, for the simple creature may house a secret within its black, unblinking eyes.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope

zombies will not be able to reclaim a weapon should they be disarmed as the lack of weapon will simply drive them to claw with their broken hands.  The magic which binds the zombie to the mortal plane is tricky to the uninitiated as well, so please be warned young adventurers!  Should you fell a zombie, be aware that the creature may not be fully dead for the second time; you should always be sure to wait and see if the beast attempts to rise once more before wandering deeper into the dungeon.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Token artwork by Forgotten Adventures.</em></li>\n<li><em>Bestiary entry by Penelope (Vyrnali).</em></li>\n</ul>","public":""},"alignment":"Neutral Evil","race":null,"type":{"value":"undead","subtype":"","swarm":"","custom":""},"environment":"Urban","cr":0.25,"spellLevel":0,"xp":{"value":50},"source":"MM pg. 316","class":{}},"traits":{"size":"med","di":{"value":["poison"],"custom":""},"dr":{"value":[],"custom":""},"dv":{"value":[],"custom":""},"ci":{"value":["poisoned"],"custom":""},"languages":{"value":[],"custom":"understands the languages it knew in life but can't speak"}},"currency":{"pp":0,"gp":0,"ep":0,"sp":0,"cp":0},"skills":{"acr":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"ani":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"arc":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ath":{"value":0,"ability":"str","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":1,"bonus":0,"passive":11,"prof":0,"total":1},"dec":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"his":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"ins":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"itm":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"inv":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"med":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"nat":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"prc":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"prf":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"per":{"value":0,"ability":"cha","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-3,"bonus":0,"passive":7,"prof":0,"total":-3},"rel":{"value":0,"ability":"int","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-4,"bonus":0,"passive":6,"prof":0,"total":-4},"slt":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"ste":{"value":0,"ability":"dex","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2},"sur":{"value":0,"ability":"wis","bonuses":{"check":"","passive":""},"mod":-2,"bonus":0,"passive":8,"prof":0,"total":-2}},"spells":{"spell1":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell2":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell3":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell4":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell5":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell6":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell7":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell8":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"spell9":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0},"pact":{"value":0,"override":null,"max":0,"level":0},"spell0":{"value":0,"max":0}},"bonuses":{"mwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rwak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"msak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"rsak":{"attack":"","damage":""},"abilities":{"check":"","save":"","skill":""},"spell":{"dc":""}},"resources":{"legact":{"value":0,"max":0},"legres":{"value":0,"max":0},"lair":{"value":false,"initiative":0}}},"token":{"name":"Zombie","displayName":20,"actorLink":false,"tint":null,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"vision":false,"dimSight":60,"brightSight":0,"dimLight":0,"brightLight":0,"sightAngle":0,"lightAngle":0,"lightColor":null,"lightAlpha":1,"lightAnimation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":40,"bar1":{"attribute":"attributes.hp"},"bar2":{"attribute":""},"flags":{},"randomImg":false,"img":"systems/dnd5e/tokens/undead/Zombie.webp","actorId":"NAISFPoNNgUCsEyW","alpha":1,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}}},"items":[{"_id":"Ed7XgnZu9qRs3qdn","name":"Slam","type":"weapon","img":"icons/skills/melee/unarmed-punch-fist-yellow-red.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<section class=\"secret\"><p><em>Melee Weapon Attack:</em><strong>+3 to hit,</strong>, <strong>5 ft.,</strong> one target.
